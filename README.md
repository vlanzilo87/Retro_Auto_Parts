To build this website I utilized a variety of technologies including node.js(js outside browser), express(server), ejs(html/js), mongo(database), mongoose(connect to database, method override (edit/delete), html, css, and javascript. I wanted to build a place where people can buy new/used parts for older vehicles, for now just 1990 BMW E30. Eventually I would add other vehicle models, each with their own page.

There are a couple things I'd like to fix for the mobile version; footer and image display. I also would of liked to include some sort of animation on the welcome page. And buy button functionality. I tried adding a request page to list part requests but couldn't get the link to post the requests to that page without an error.
